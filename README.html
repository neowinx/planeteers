<h1>Suchi and Ma-ti</h1>
<p><img alt="suchi and ma-ti image" src="doc/img/Heroforearth062.jpg" /></p>
<p>This repository contains the information for devices that sends Particulate Matter information to receiving nodes using LoRa for <a href="https://airelib.re/">AireLibre</a></p>
<p>It consists of two main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neowinx/planeteers/tree/main/suchi-firmware">Suchi</a>: The firmware for the sensors that sends the data</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/neowinx/planeteers/tree/main/ma-ti-firmware">Ma-ti</a>: The firmware for the node that receives the data from <strong>suchi</strong> and forwards it to <a href="https://github.com/garyservin/linka-firmware">Linka</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Whats the big idea?</h2>
<p>The idea is to have a way to deploy multiple nodes that report the values gathered from the PMS to some areas where the access
to a network connection or even electricity are somewhat restricted or areas where makes sense to deploy some hardware
under minimal infraestructure, or even off the grid, to gather the particulate matter information</p>
<p>The following "cutting edge" animation will show the idea in a more "eye-candy" way:</p>
<p><img alt="suchi and ma-ti animation" src="doc/img/suchi-and-matti.gif" /></p>
<p>Every node on the field shoul finally be independently working suchi node should look something like this (image only for reference)</p>

<p><strong> These parts are just here for reference since I will test them on christmas (no, I am not kidding, I need to wait 3 months for these stuff to arrive) </strong>
- Solar Panel 5V 250mA (anny size will do, but it needs to fit in the top off your case) <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&amp;initiative_id=SB_20210928063647&amp;SearchText=Solar+Panel+5V+250mA">AliExpress</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Solar+Panel+5V+250mA&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a>

<h3>Boards</h3>
<p>Both projects (suchi and ma-ti) supports the next boards as the core hardware (we will be adding more in the near future)</p>
<h4>TTGO T-Beam</h4>
<ul>
<li>TTGO T-Beam ESP32 915MHz <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001178678568.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.55c05386IacCzc&amp;algo_pvid=b483f02b-ea80-4f11-bde8-c2762328d077&amp;algo_exp_id=b483f02b-ea80-4f11-bde8-c2762328d077-0&amp;pdp_ext_f={&quot;sku_id&quot;%3A&quot;12000024058303348&quot;}">AliExpress</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LILYGO-Meshtastic-T-Beam-Bluetooth-Battery/dp/B097H11PJY/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ttgo+t-beam&amp;qid=1632840422&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="TTGO T-Bean board image" src="doc/img/TTGOTBEAMV10_1-500x500.jpg" /></p>
<p>This board comes with an esp32, a NEO-6M GPS module, a Bluethoot module and a SX1276 LoRa module embedded in the board.
Also comes with an external antenna and a 18650 battery holder</p>
<p>It is the more expensive alternative, but it comes with almost everything needed to deploy a node right away</p>
<p><strong> Wiring for Suchi </strong></p>
<p>Just connect the Plantower pins corresponding to the ground and voltage and use the pins 2 and 13 for the Rx and Tx communication</p>
<p><strong> Wiring for Ma-ti </strong></p>
<p>No need to wire anything since everything is already connected in the board. So, here's a kitty</p>

<h4>HopeRF with Esp32 devkit v1.1</h4>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I just recently find out about all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa#LoRaWAN"> LoRa </a> stuff, and since it's relatively new to me (even though it has been around quite some years already)
I have been trying to devise a project to use it</p>
<p>Around this time, I stumble with the <a href="https://airelib.re/"> AireLibre </a> initiave, and since the project is revolving around 
ubiquitous sensors, the opportunitty of implementing a self sustainable sensor (solar charged, low power) using hobbiest 
level hardware was the answer I was looking for!</p>
<h3>Why two separate projects?</h3>
<p>I know that probably there's no need to separate both roles (the sender and the receiver) in two projects, since we could've just manage those differences using precompiled macros</p>
<p>The reason for not doing that, is that we want a minimal codebase in order to have a small memory footprint for the nodes, and having to manage precompiled macros and the resulting
code from them will probably result in someone (mainly myself) making a regrettable mistake</p>
<p>Also, it looks cleaner to have those two things separated for people not very keen into coding but that wants to contribute to the project in a foreseeable future, so in the meantime
we will mantain these two projects until we see otherwise even if that means that some lines of code will be duplicated</p>
<h3>Why not LoRaWAN?</h3>
<p>The first prototype for this project was indeed a LoRaWAN node in order to use the <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/"> TTN infraestructure </a></p>
<p>But gateways are rather
scarse in <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/community"> Paraguay </a> (0 gateways actually in my city) so I began to construct one of those single channel gateways 
(or single channel relays.. or whatever they are called now...)
for testing purposes, only to find out that those are <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/the-future-of-single-channel-gateways/6590"> condemned by the TTN community </a>
and that the <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/the-things-network-v2-is-permanently-shutting-down-scheduled/50710"> V2 of the TTN will be shutdown this 1 of december 2021 </a></p>
<p>Because of this, at the current date, TTN V2 is not registering new gateways anymore, only leaving me with the V3 option that only accepts official (proper) gateways from one of the
selected manufacturers or to <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/start/build/"> buildin a proper one </a> myself.</p>
<p>All that just gives me the same headache you're probably having now, so I will only use LoRa for the moment since the application in this case scenario is rather
simple</p>
<p>Maybe in the future I will reevaluate to use LoRaWAN</p>
<p>Thank you for reading until this point, If I haven't lost you, let's proceed to the more interesting part of the project</p>
